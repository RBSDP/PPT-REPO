A constructor is a special method or function in object-oriented programming languages that is used for initializing objects.
It is called automatically when an object is created from a class and is responsible for setting the initial state of the object.

The purpose of a constructor is to perform tasks such as allocating memory for the object, initializing member variables, and performing any necessary setup or initialization steps.
Constructors ensure that objects are properly initialized before they are used.

Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to and do not have a return type, not even void.
They can have parameters to accept values that are used to initialize the object's state. Constructors can be overloaded, meaning a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists, allowing objects to be created in different ways.

By using constructors, you can ensure that objects are created with valid initial values and that any necessary setup is performed consistently.
Constructors play a crucial role in object-oriented programming as they enable the creation of objects and define how they are initialized.
