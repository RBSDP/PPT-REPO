The main differences between `var` and `let` in JavaScript are as follows:

1. Scope: Variables declared with `var` have function scope or global scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function or globally if declared outside of any function. Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block where they are defined.

2. Hoisting: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope and can be accessed before their actual declaration. However, they are initialized with the value `undefined` until their actual assignment is reached.
     Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted, but they remain in the "temporal dead zone" until their actual declaration is encountered, and accessing them before the declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

3. Redeclaration: Variables declared with `var` can be redeclared within the same scope without any error. Redeclaring a variable with `let` within the same scope will result in a `SyntaxError`.

4. Block Scope: Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are limited to the block where they are defined (e.g., within loops or if statements). This allows for better control and prevents unintended variable leakage.

5. Global Scope Behavior: Variables declared with `var` outside of any function are attached to the global object (`window` object in browsers). Variables declared with `let` outside of any block are not attached to the global object.

Given these differences, it is generally recommended to use `let` instead of `var` in modern JavaScript development. `let` provides better scoping behavior, avoids common pitfalls related to hoisting and redeclaration, and promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.
