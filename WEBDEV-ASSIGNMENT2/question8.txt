Absolute and Relative Positioning:
1. Relative Positioning: With relative positioning, an element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. It can be moved using `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties. Other elements still flow around it. Example: 
```css
.relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 10px;
}
```

2. Absolute Positioning: With absolute positioning, an element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor exists. It is completely removed from the normal document flow, and other elements ignore its space. Example:
```css
.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

Sticky and Fixed Positioning:
1. Fixed Positioning: With fixed positioning, an element is positioned relative to the browser window, even when the page is scrolled. It remains fixed at a specific position. Example:
```css
.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
}
```

2. Sticky Positioning: Sticky positioning is a hybrid between relative and fixed positioning. It behaves like relative positioning until the element reaches a specified threshold (usually when the user scrolls past it), then it becomes fixed. Example:
```css
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
```
In this example, the `.sticky` element will be positioned normally until the user scrolls to the top, where it will stick to the top of the viewport.
