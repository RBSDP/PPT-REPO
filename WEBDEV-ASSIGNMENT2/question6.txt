The z-index property in CSS controls the stacking order of positioned elements on the z-axis, determining which elements appear on top of others.

The z-index property accepts integer values and works as follows:

1. Elements with a higher z-index value are stacked above elements with a lower value.
2. If two elements have the same z-index, the one appearing later in the HTML markup will be stacked on top.
3. By default, elements have a z-index of auto, which means they stack in the order they appear in the HTML.

For z-index to work, the element must have a position value other than static. Common position values used with z-index are relative, absolute, and fixed. These position values establish a new stacking context for the element and its descendants.

When stacking elements, it's important to consider that the z-index property only affects elements within the same stacking context. Elements outside of a stacking context will not be affected by the z-index of elements inside it.

By manipulating the z-index values of elements, you can control their overlapping behavior and create layered layouts, allowing certain elements to appear above or below others visually.
