The main differences between inline, inline-block, and block display properties in CSS are as follows:

1.) Inline:
 Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much horizontal space as necessary.
 They flow alongside each other within a line. Examples of inline elements are `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<strong>`. 
 By default, the height and width properties have no effect on inline elements.

2.)Inline-block:
 Inline-block elements behave similarly to inline elements in that they do not start on a new line.
 However, they can have a specified width, height, margins, and padding. 
 This allows them to occupy space horizontally while still respecting vertical alignment and flowing alongside other inline or inline-block elements.

3.) Block:
 Block elements, such as <div>, <p>, and <h1>, start on a new line and occupy the entire width available to them.
  They have a line break before and after them. Block elements can have a specified width, height, margins, and padding, and they stack vertically on top of each other by default.
