A media query in CSS is a feature that allows you to apply different CSS styles based on certain conditions, such as the characteristics of the device or the browser displaying the web page.
It is primarily used to create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes, devices, and user preferences.

The purpose of media queries is to provide a way to tailor the presentation of a website or application based on the capabilities and constraints of the device or viewport.
By using media queries, you can specify different styles for different screen widths, resolutions, orientations (landscape or portrait), device types (desktop, tablet, mobile), and even specific features supported by the browser.
