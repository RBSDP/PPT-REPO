In responsive web design, breakpoints are specific points or ranges of screen widths where the layout of a website or application changes to adapt to different devices or viewport sizes.
They are used to define different sets of CSS styles that should be applied at different screen sizes to ensure optimal display and usability.

Breakpoints are typically defined using media queries in CSS.
Media queries with breakpoints allow you to target specific screen widths or ranges of widths and apply different CSS rules accordingly.
By doing so, you can create a fluid and responsive layout that adjusts its design and behavior to provide the best user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
