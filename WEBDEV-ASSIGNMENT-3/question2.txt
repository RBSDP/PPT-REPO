To define a media query in CSS, you use the @media rule followed by a media type and one or more media features.
The media type and media features specify the conditions under which the styles within the media query will be applied.
Here's the general syntax:

@media mediaType and (mediaFeature1: value1) and (mediaFeature2: value2) {
    /* CSS styles to apply */
}
