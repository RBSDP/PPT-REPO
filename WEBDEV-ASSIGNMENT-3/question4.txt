The purpose of using media queries for print media is to define specific styles and layout adjustments that are applied when a web page is printed or previewed for printing.
Media queries provide a way to optimize the appearance and readability of printed content, ensuring that it is well-suited for the characteristics of printed output such as paper size, ink usage, and page margins.



By using media queries for print media, you can:

Control page breaks: 

Specify where page breaks should occur to ensure that content is appropriately divided across printed pages.
 This can help prevent awkward splits in the middle of paragraphs or important sections.

Adjust font sizes and styles:

Optimize the text size, line spacing, and font styles for legibility on printed material.
Larger font sizes and different font choices may be more suitable for printed documents compared to on-screen displays.

Remove unnecessary elements:
Hide or modify certain elements that are not relevant or needed for print, such as navigation menus, sidebars, or interactive components.
This helps to conserve paper and create a cleaner, more focused printed output.
