

1. Static Position:
```html
<div class="static-position">Static Position</div>
```
```css
.static-position {
  position: static;
  background-color: yellow;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
Explanation: The `position: static;` is the default position value. It places the element in the normal flow of the document, and no special positioning is applied. The element will not be affected by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` properties.

2. Fixed Position:
```html
<div class="fixed-position">Fixed Position</div>
```
```css
.fixed-position {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  background-color: red;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
Explanation: The `position: fixed;` value positions the element relative to the viewport, regardless of scrolling. It is fixed in a specific position on the screen. In this example, the element is positioned 20 pixels from the top and 20 pixels from the right of the viewport.

3. Sticky Position:
```html
<div class="sticky-position">Sticky Position</div>
```
```css
.sticky-position {
  position: sticky;
  top: 50px;
  background-color: green;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
Explanation: The `position: sticky;` value positions the element based on the user's scroll position. It behaves like `relative` until it reaches a specified threshold (e.g., when the element reaches the top of its container or a specified offset), and then becomes `fixed`. In this example, the element is sticky and remains 50 pixels from the top of its container.

4. Relative Position:
```html
<div class="relative-position">Relative Position</div>
```
```css
.relative-position {
  position: relative;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
  background-color: blue;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
Explanation: The `position: relative;` value positions the element relative to its normal position in the document flow. The `top` and `left` properties are used to move the element 30 pixels down and 30 pixels to the right from its original position.

5. Absolute Position:
```html
<div class="absolute-position-container">
  <div class="absolute-position">Absolute Position</div>
</div>
```
```css
.absolute-position-container {
  position: relative;
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.absolute-position {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 50px;
  background-color: orange;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
Explanation: The `position: absolute;` value positions the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor exists. In this example, the parent container has `position: relative;`, and the child element is positioned absolutely within it. The child element is 50 pixels from the top and 50 pixels from the left of the parent container.
