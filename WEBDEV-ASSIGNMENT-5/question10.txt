To define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using `async/await`, you declare a function with the `async` keyword.
The `async` keyword signifies that the function will contain asynchronous code and will always return a Promise.

Here's the syntax for defining an asynchronous function:

```javascript
async function functionName() {
  // Asynchronous code
}
```

Within an asynchronous function, you can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until a Promise settles.
The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function.
It waits for the Promise to be fulfilled and then returns the resolved value.
If the Promise is rejected, an error will be thrown.

Here's an example of an asynchronous function that uses `await`:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

In the example above:

1. The `getData` function is declared as an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword.

2. Inside the function, the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution at specific points where promises are being awaited. In this case, `await` is used with the `fetch()` function to wait for the response to be resolved before proceeding.

3. Once the response is obtained, `await` is used again with `response.json()` to wait for the JSON parsing to complete.

4. The resolved data is returned from the function.

5. If any error occurs during the execution of `fetch()` or `response.json()`, the `catch` block is executed, and the error is logged.
