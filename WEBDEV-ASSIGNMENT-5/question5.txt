Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed later, typically when an asynchronous operation completes.
They allow you to specify what should happen after the asynchronous operation finishes.

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, is a term used to describe a situation where multiple nested callbacks are used in asynchronous JavaScript code.
It occurs when you have a chain of asynchronous operations that depend on each other, resulting in deeply nested callbacks.
This can lead to code that is hard to read, understand, and maintain.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of Callback Hell:

```javascript
asyncOperation1((error, result1) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    asyncOperation2(result1, (error, result2) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(error);
      } else {
        asyncOperation3(result2, (error, result3) => {
          if (error) {
            console.error(error);
          } else {
            // ...more nested callbacks
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
```

As you can see, as the number of asynchronous operations increases and they become dependent on each other, the nesting of callbacks becomes deeper and more complex.
This can make the code difficult to read, debug, and maintain.

To mitigate Callback Hell, there are several techniques available:

1. **Named Functions:** Instead of using anonymous functions as callbacks, define named functions separately and pass them as callbacks. This helps in separating concerns and makes the code more readable.

2. **Modularization:** Break down the asynchronous operations into smaller, modular functions. This reduces the nesting and makes the code more organized and easier to understand.

3. **Promises:** Use Promises, which provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous code. Promises allow you to chain operations using `.then()` and handle errors using `.catch()`, resulting in flatter and more manageable code.

4. **Async/Await:** Utilize async/await, which is built on top of Promises and provides a more synchronous-like coding style for handling asynchronous operations. Async functions and the `await` keyword make the code appear sequential and easier to comprehend.
