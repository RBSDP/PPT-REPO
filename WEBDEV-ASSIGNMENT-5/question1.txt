Synchronous and asynchronous are two different modes of communication or execution in various systems, including computer programming and telecommunications.
Here's an explanation of the differences between the two:

Synchronous:
- In synchronous communication or execution, the sender and receiver are in direct coordination with each other.
- It follows a request-response model, where the sender sends a request, and the receiver waits for the response before proceeding further.
- The sender and receiver must be available and actively engaged during the communication or execution process.
- Synchronous communication is typically blocking, meaning that the sender will be blocked or halted until it receives a response from the receiver.
- Examples of synchronous communication include phone calls, face-to-face conversations, and traditional client-server interactions.

Asynchronous:
- In asynchronous communication or execution, the sender and receiver are not required to be actively engaged at the same time.
- It does not follow a strict request-response model, and the sender does not wait for an immediate response.
- The sender can continue with other tasks without waiting for the receiver's response.
- Asynchronous communication is typically non-blocking, meaning that the sender does not get blocked while waiting for a response.
- It is often used when there is a time delay, unreliable connections, or when the sender and receiver operate at different speeds or on different schedules.
- Examples of asynchronous communication include email, text messaging, and message queues in programming.
